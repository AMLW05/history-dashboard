- **AI Grading**: NOT used for Project Checkpoints, Discussion Boards, or Final Project (all manually graded by instructor)

#### 4.2 Instructor Presence Documentation
- Announcements posted by instructor Canvas account
- Discussion board posts/replies by instructor Canvas account
- Project Checkpoint feedback via Canvas SpeedGrader by instructor
- Final Project evaluation by instructor
- Office hours held by instructor (synchronous presence)
- Email responses from instructor

#### 4.3 Scalability Considerations
- Course designed for typical community college section size (20-30 students)
- Instructor workload estimation:
  - Weekly announcements: 30 minutes/week
  - Discussion Board participation (4 discussions): 3-4 hours per discussion week
  - Project Checkpoint grading (3 checkpoints × 25 students × 15 min each): 18.75 hours per checkpoint
  - Final Project grading (25 students × 30 min each): 12.5 hours
  - Email support: 2-3 hours/week
  - Office hours: 4 hours/week
- **Total: Feasible for single instructor without TA support**

**No outsourcing to TAs or automation** = True instructor-student interaction

2. **Inquiry-Based Pedagogy**: 24 inquiry questions frame each module, promoting critical thinking over memorization; portfolio project "What is America?" provides authentic, semester-long investigation

3. **Free, High-Quality Materials**: The American Yawp (award-winning, $0 cost) + American Yawp Reader eliminate textbook cost barriers; total course cost beyond tuition: $0

4. **Diverse Perspectives Emphasis**: CLO2 explicitly requires evaluating how diverse groups shaped American society; course materials center Indigenous, African American, women's, and marginalized voices

5. **Progressive Skill Development**: Six Historical Thinking Skills (Source Analysis, Chronological Reasoning, Contextualization, Comparison, Argumentation, Data Literacy) scaffolded across 8 modules

6. **Data Literacy Integration**: Two featured data analysis activities (Election of 1800, Reform Movements) teach quantitative reasoning in humanities context

7. **Balanced Assessment**: 49% auto-graded (immediate feedback) + 51% manual-graded (substantive instructor feedback); multiple assessment types accommodate learning differences

8. **Accessibility by Design**: UDL principles embedded; multiple modalities; free, web-based materials; WCAG 2.1 AA standards; zero technology barriers

9. **Exceptional RSI Compliance**: 48+ instructor-initiated substantive interactions per student; exceeds federal requirements

10. **Program Integration**: Clear connections to HIS-132 (American History II), HIS-111/112 (World Civilizations); thematic progressions across history program
