    prompt: `The 1850s saw sectional tensions escalate toward civil war. Choose ONE perspective:

1. **Northern Free Soiler**: You oppose slavery's expansion but don't necessarily support abolition or racial equality. Why do you fear slavery's spread into western territories?

2. **Southern Planter**: You view Northern criticism of slavery as attack on your way of life, property rights, and racial order. How do you defend slavery and states' rights?

3. **Northern Abolitionist**: You demand immediate emancipation. How do events like Fugitive Slave Act and Dred Scott decision radicalize your activism?

4. **Border State Moderate**: Living in Missouri or Kentucky, you try to find middle ground. Why does compromise become increasingly impossible?

**Initial Post** (250+ words):
- Explain your position on slavery and its expansion
- Discuss specific 1850s events (Compromise of 1850, Kansas-Nebraska Act, Dred Scott, John Brown)
- Use historical evidence from course materials
- Explain why compromise failed

**Peer Responses** (100+ words each, respond to 2):
- Engage with someone from DIFFERENT perspective
- Explain points of fundamental disagreement
- Discuss: Was Civil War inevitable by 1860? Why or why not?`,

Choose ONE question to explore:

1. **Reconstruction's Legacy**: Why did the "Lost Cause" mythology succeed in reshaping how Americans remembered the Civil War and Reconstruction? What were the consequences of this false narrative?

2. **Reform Movements**: Compare reform strategies across the course (abolition, women's rights, Populism). What made some movements succeed while others failed? What tactics were most effective?

3. **Historical Memory**: Choose one event from the course. How has public memory of this event changed over time? Why does how we remember matter for today?

4. **Unfulfilled Promises**: The Declaration of Independence claimed "all men are created equal." Track one group's (women, African Americans, Native peoples, immigrants) struggle for inclusion 1776-1900. Why did exclusion persist?

**Initial Post** (300+ words):
- Make an argument answering your chosen question
- Use specific examples from across multiple modules
- Connect past to present: why does this history matter today?
- Demonstrate synthesis: bring together themes from entire course

**Peer Responses** (100+ words each, respond to 2):
- Engage with different question than yours
- Make connections across different course periods
- Discuss: How does understanding this history help us understand America today?`,
