## CONCLUSION

**HIS-131: American History I is READY for internal certification submission.**

The course meets or exceeds all 22 QM Essential Standards with comprehensive evidence documented across course data, dashboard interface, and support materials. The course demonstrates exceptional alignment, inquiry-based pedagogy, progressive skill development, and extensive learner support.

**Certification Recommendation**: **APPROVE** for internal certification

**Auditor Notes**: This is an exemplary model of backward design with particular strengths in inquiry-based learning, progressive Historical Thinking Skills development, and equity-centered course design (zero-cost materials, accessible technologies). The "What is America?" portfolio project provides meaningful capstone experience connecting 8 modules of learning. The data analysis activities (Modules 3 & 6) introduce quantitative reasoning into humanities course. Recommend using this course as template for HIS-132 development.
