**Why Chicago Style?**
- Standard format for history papers
- Allows for detailed footnotes
- Distinguishes between primary and secondary sources

**Quick Reference Guide**:

**Book Citation**:
- Footnote: Author, *Title* (City: Publisher, Year), page.
- Example: ¹Eric Foner, *Give Me Liberty!* (New York: Norton, 2014), 234.

**Journal Article**:
- Footnote: Author, "Title," *Journal* volume, no. issue (Year): pages.
- Example: ²Annette Gordon-Reed, "America's Original Sin," *Foreign Affairs* 97, no. 1 (2018): 2-7.

**Primary Source from American Yawp**:
- Footnote: Author, "Document Title," in *The American Yawp Reader*, accessed Date, URL.
- Example: ³Thomas Jefferson, "Declaration of Independence," in *The American Yawp Reader*, accessed January 15, 2026, https://www.americanyawp.com/reader/...

                heading: "Writing Historical Arguments",
                content: `**Thesis Statement Essentials**:

A strong thesis is:
1. **Specific**: Not "The Civil War was important" but "Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation transformed the Civil War from a conflict about union into a war for freedom"
2. **Arguable**: Someone could disagree with your claim
3. **Evidence-based**: You can support it with historical sources
4. **Clear**: Reader understands your main argument immediately

**Thesis Templates**:
- "Although X, actually Y because of Z."
- "X led to Y by [mechanism/process]."
- "While historians often argue X, evidence shows Y."

**Paragraph Structure** (TEEL):
- **T**opic Sentence: State your point
- **E**vidence: Provide historical evidence/examples
- **E**xplanation: Analyze how evidence supports your point
- **L**ink: Connect back to thesis

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
❌ Presentism: Judging past by today's standards
❌ Generalizing: "Everyone believed..." (Who exactly?)
❌ Plot summary: Just retelling events without analysis
❌ Vague statements: "It was very important..." (How? Why?)
✅ Analyze causes, effects, and significance`

Examples:
- Letters, diaries, speeches
- Newspaper articles from the era
- Government documents, laws
- Photographs, artifacts
- Oral histories, interviews

**Secondary Sources** = Created AFTER analyzing primary sources
Examples:
- History textbooks
- Scholarly journal articles
- Biographies written later
- Documentary films
- Museum interpretations

**Why Use Primary Sources?**
- Get direct access to historical perspectives
- See how people thought at the time
- Develop your own interpretations
- Practice historical thinking skills

**How to Analyze Primary Sources**:
1. **Sourcing**: Who created it? When? Why?
2. **Context**: What was happening at this time?
3. **Close Reading**: What does it actually say?
4. **Corroboration**: Do other sources agree?
5. **Interpretation**: What does this reveal about the past?`
