## RSI COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Criterion 1: Instructor-Initiated Interaction

**Requirement**: Instructor must initiate interaction (not just respond to student requests)

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - Multiple instructor-initiated touchpoints throughout 16-week term

**Evidence**:

#### 1.1 Weekly Course Announcements (16 total)
- **Frequency**: Weekly throughout 16-week term (every week, no gaps)
- **Initiative**: Instructor posts announcements proactively (not waiting for student questions)
- **Substantive**: Announcements include historical guidance, not just logistics
- **Documented**: Canvas announcement feature with timestamp

**Example Week 1 Announcement**:
"Welcome to Module 1: Indigenous America & First Contact! This week, you'll explore three compelling inquiry questions: Who lived in the Americas before 1492? What happened when Europeans, Africans, and Indigenous peoples first encountered each other? How did disease shape colonization outcomes more than military conquest?

As you read American Yawp Chapters 1-2, use your Guided Notes to identify key civilizations like Cahokia and the Haudenosaunee. Pay attention to the concept of the Columbian Exchange - we'll analyze its demographic and economic impacts in your Learning Activities.

Your first Project Checkpoint is due this module. Remember: this is your first step in answering 'What is America?' Focus on gathering strong primary and secondary sources. Visit the Library if you need research help!

Looking forward to beginning this historical journey with you all."

**This interaction is**:
- ✅ Instructor-initiated (posted proactively at module start)
- ✅ Regular (weekly, predictable)
- ✅ Substantive (historical content guidance, not just "Module 1 is open")

---

#### 1.2 Discussion Board Prompts & Participation (4 discussions)
- **Frequency**: Modules 2, 4, 6, 8 (spaced throughout 16-week term)
- **Initiative**: Instructor posts discussion prompt and participates in threads
- **Substantive**: Prompts tied to inquiry questions, require evidence-based historical analysis
- **Documented**: Canvas discussion board with instructor posts/replies visible

**Example Module 2 Discussion Prompt**:
"Discussion Board 1: Colonial Tensions & Portfolio Piece #2

Our inquiry question this module asks: How did English colonists transform fluid racial categories into fixed legal systems of slavery?

For this discussion:
1. **Initial Post (by Wednesday)**: Using evidence from American Yawp Chapters 3-4, analyze ONE factor that contributed to the development of race-based slavery in British North America. Consider: Bacon's Rebellion, labor needs, legal changes, or economic pressures. Your post should be 250-300 words and cite specific evidence.

2. **Portfolio Integration**: Share your Portfolio Piece #2 (your chosen source/artifact for this module). Explain how it relates to colonial tensions around race, labor, and power.

3. **Peer Replies (by Sunday)**: Respond to TWO classmates' posts. Compare their analysis to yours, ask follow-up questions, or provide additional evidence that supports or complicates their argument. Each reply should be 100+ words.

I'll be checking in throughout the week to pose follow-up questions and connect your analyses to broader themes. Let's dig into this challenging history together."

**Instructor Participation Throughout Discussion Week**:
- Posts initial prompt (Monday)
- Replies to student posts with follow-up questions (Wednesday-Friday)
- Connects different students' perspectives (Friday)
- Posts end-of-week summary synthesizing themes (Sunday)

**Example Instructor Reply**:
"@Student1: You make a compelling argument about labor shortages driving the shift to enslaved African labor. I'm curious - how does this connect to the legal changes we see in Virginia's slave codes? Take a look at the 1662 law regarding children of enslaved mothers. What does this reveal about how colonists were codifying racial slavery into law?

@Student2: Your point about Bacon's Rebellion is excellent. Can you elaborate on why elite planters saw race-based slavery as a way to prevent future poor white/Black alliances? Think about the 'divide and conquer' strategy..."

**This interaction is**:
- ✅ Instructor-initiated (instructor posts prompt, doesn't wait for students to create discussion)
- ✅ Regular (4 discussions spaced throughout term: weeks 3-4, 7-8, 11-12, 15-16)
- ✅ Substantive (historical analysis, evidence evaluation, argumentation - not just "share your thoughts")
- ✅ Two-way (instructor replies to students, poses follow-up questions, facilitates discourse)

---

#### 1.3 Project Checkpoint Feedback (3 times)
- **Frequency**: Modules 1, 3, 5 (weeks 1-2, 5-6, 9-10)
- **Initiative**: Instructor reviews and provides individualized written feedback
- **Substantive**: Feedback addresses historical thinking skills, source analysis, argumentation quality
- **Documented**: Canvas SpeedGrader with timestamp and feedback comments

**Example Project Checkpoint 1 Feedback** (Module 1, 50 points):
"Checkpoint 1: Initial Definition + Piece #1

**Strengths**:
- Excellent source selection: Your choice of the Haudenosaunee Great Law of Peace as a primary source demonstrates sophisticated thinking about Indigenous governance systems.
- Good contextualization: You've placed this source in the broader context of pre-Columbian political developments.
- Clear initial definition: Your answer to 'What is America?' shows you're grappling with the question thoughtfully.

**Areas for Growth**:
- Source analysis depth: While you've identified WHAT the Great Law says, push deeper into WHY it matters. How does Haudenosaunee democracy challenge European assumptions about Indigenous societies? Consider adding analysis of the influence on later American democratic principles.
- Evidence integration: Your secondary source (American Yawp) is used well, but consider adding one more scholarly source. Check the Library databases for articles on Haudenosaunee governance.
- Argumentation: Your thesis is emerging, but needs more specificity. Instead of 'America began with diverse societies,' try something like 'America's democratic foundations include often-overlooked Indigenous governance models that preceded and influenced European colonial structures.'

**Next Steps for Checkpoint 2** (Module 3):
Build on this foundation by examining how colonial encounters transformed both Indigenous and European societies. Your Revolutionary Voice piece should show change over time from this Indigenous baseline.

**Grade**: 43/50 (Proficient level)
**Historical Thinking Skills Demonstrated**: Source Analysis (HTS1), Contextualization (HTS3)

Feel free to visit office hours if you want to discuss source analysis strategies!

Great start to your portfolio! 📚"

#### 1.4 Final Project Comprehensive Feedback (1 time)
- **Frequency**: Module 7 (weeks 13-14)
- **Initiative**: Instructor evaluates complete portfolio with comprehensive feedback
- **Substantive**: Feedback addresses synthesis across entire course, CLO achievement, historical communication
- **Documented**: Canvas SpeedGrader with extensive comments

**Example Final Project Feedback** (Module 7, 200 points):
"Final Portfolio: 'What is America?' Complete Journey

**Overall Assessment**: Your portfolio demonstrates significant growth in historical thinking from Module 1 to Module 7. The evolution of your answer to 'What is America?' shows sophisticated understanding of complexity, change over time, and diverse perspectives.

**CLO 1 (Analyze historical development)**: EXCEEDS
Your analysis of political, social, and economic development from pre-Columbian times through 1865 is comprehensive. Particularly strong: your connection between early colonial racial hierarchies (Module 2) and sectional crisis arguments about slavery expansion (Module 7). This demonstrates understanding of long-term causation.

**CLO 2 (Evaluate diverse groups)**: MEETS
You've consistently included Native American, African American, and women's perspectives throughout your portfolio. Your Module 6 Reform Strategies piece effectively evaluates how women's participation in abolitionism led to women's rights advocacy. To move to EXCEEDS: consider more explicit comparison of different groups' strategies for change.

**CLO 3 (Apply historical thinking)**: MEETS
Source analysis improved significantly from Checkpoint 1 to Final Project. Your use of primary sources (Haudenosaunee Great Law, enslaved people's narratives, Seneca Falls Declaration) demonstrates ability to interpret diverse source types. Data analysis activities (Election of 1800, Reform Movements) show quantitative reasoning skills.

**CLO 4 (Communicate effectively)**: EXCEEDS
Your final presentation is clear, well-organized, and visually compelling. The narrative arc from 'What is America?' in 1491 to 1865 is coherent. Excellent use of evidence to support claims. Strong synthesis of 7 portfolio pieces into unified argument.

**Standout Moments**:
- Module 1: Challenging European assumptions about Indigenous societies
- Module 3: Revolutionary Voice piece examining contradictions between liberty rhetoric and slavery reality
- Module 5: Map of Ambition showing spatial dimensions of Indian Removal
- Module 7: Final synthesis connecting all themes to answer 'What is America?'

**Historical Thinking Skills Progression**:
You've demonstrated growth across all 6 Historical Thinking Skills. Particularly notable: your argumentation (HTS5) evolved from basic thesis statements (Module 1) to complex, evidence-based arguments (Module 7). Data literacy (HTS6) improved through Election of 1800 and Reform Movements analyses.

**Areas for Continued Growth** (for HIS-132):
- Deepen comparative analysis (HTS4): Compare not just different groups, but different time periods and regions
- Expand source base: Incorporate more scholarly secondary sources alongside primary sources
- Consider presentism: How do current issues shape our interpretation of past events?

**Final Grade**: 185/200 (A-)

**Instructor Note**: This portfolio shows the kind of historical thinking that prepares you for success in HIS-132 and beyond. You've moved from seeing history as facts to understanding it as interpretation, argument, and evidence. Well done on a semester of hard work and intellectual growth! 🎓"

**This interaction is**:

- ✅ Substantive (historical content review, study strategies, concept clarification)

---

### Criterion 2: Substantive Interaction (Instructional Content)

**Requirement**: Interaction must engage students on course content and learning (not just administrative)

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - All interactions focus on historical learning, not administration

**Evidence**:

#### 2.1 Course Announcements = Historical Guidance (Not Administrative Reminders)

**Substantive Content in Announcements**:
- Framing module themes and inquiry questions
- Highlighting connections between current and previous modules
- Pointing out key evidence in American Yawp chapters
- Linking Historical Thinking Skills to module content
- Providing historical context for controversial topics

**Example Module 6 Announcement** (Substantive Historical Content):
"Welcome to Module 6: Reform & Social Movements (1820-1850)!

This module explores a fascinating period when Americans channeled religious fervor into social reform. Our inquiry questions ask: How did evangelical revivals inspire reform movements? Why was abolitionism so divisive? How did women's reform participation lead to women's rights advocacy?

**Historical Context**: The Second Great Awakening (1790s-1840s) created a 'moral reform' impulse. Americans believed they could perfect society through individual and social change. This wasn't just about religion - it became about temperance, education, prisons, mental health institutions, and most controversially, slavery.

**Key Theme - Intersecting Reforms**: Pay attention to how the same activists moved between different reform causes. Many abolitionists were also temperance advocates. Women activists moved from abolitionism to women's rights when they were excluded from leadership. Frederick Douglass supported both abolition and women's suffrage. These weren't isolated movements - they were interconnected.

**Data Analysis This Module**: Your featured Learning Activity analyzes reform movement growth data, antislavery petition numbers, and women's participation rates. This quantitative evidence reveals patterns you can't see in narrative sources alone. Think about: What does the data reveal about grassroots mobilization? How did antislavery petitioning empower women who couldn't vote?

**Discussion Board Connection**: Your DB3 asks you to evaluate different reform strategies (moral suasion vs. political action vs. radical resistance). Use your Data Analysis findings as evidence!

**Historical Thinking Skills**: This module emphasizes Comparison (HTS4) - comparing different reform movements, different strategic approaches, and different groups' participation. Also develops Contextualization (HTS3) - understanding reforms within broader economic and social changes of the era.

See you in the discussion board! 📖"

**This is substantive instructional interaction** (teaching historical thinking, not just "Module 6 is open, due dates are...")

#### 2.2 Discussion Board Prompts = Historical Inquiry (Not Generic "Share Your Thoughts")

**Substantive Discussion Design**:
- Prompts require evidence-based arguments (not opinions)
- Questions tied to inquiry approach and Historical Thinking Skills
- Expectations for historical analysis, not just personal reactions
- Integration with portfolio project (disciplinary authentic assessment)

**Example Module 4 Discussion Prompt** (Substantive Historical Discourse):
"Discussion Board 2: Democratic Ideals & Portfolio Piece #4

**Inquiry Question**: How did Jefferson's democratic rhetoric align with his actual policies regarding race and Native sovereignty?

**Historical Context**: Thomas Jefferson embodied American contradictions. He wrote 'all men are created equal' while enslaving over 600 people. He championed 'yeoman farmer' democracy while orchestrating Indigenous dispossession. He feared federal power while doubling U.S. territory through the Louisiana Purchase.

**Your Task**:
1. **Analyze ONE Jeffersonian contradiction**: Choose either:
   - A) Jefferson and slavery (rhetoric vs. reality)
   - B) Jefferson and Indigenous sovereignty (words vs. policies)
   - C) Jefferson and federal power (stated beliefs vs. actions)

2. **Use Evidence**: Cite American Yawp Chapters 7-8. Consider:
   - What did Jefferson SAY? (rhetoric, writings, speeches)
   - What did Jefferson DO? (policies, actions, decisions)
   - How do we reconcile the gap?

3. **Historical Thinking**: Apply CONTEXTUALIZATION (HTS3). Don't judge Jefferson by 21st-century standards, but DO analyze the contradictions visible to HIS contemporaries. Remember: some people in Jefferson's era (Benjamin Banneker, Lemuel Haynes) called out these contradictions.

4. **Portfolio Integration**: Share your Portfolio Piece #4 for this module. How does your chosen source/artifact illuminate Jeffersonian-era contradictions?

**Peer Replies**: Respond to TWO classmates. Compare different contradictions. Which was most consequential? Which set precedents that lasted beyond Jefferson's era?

**Instructor Role**: I'll pose follow-up questions pushing you to consider: If contemporaries saw these contradictions, why didn't they stop Jefferson? What does this reveal about whose voices had power in the Early Republic?

Let's grapple with this complex history together. Post by Wednesday so we have time for rich discussion!"

**This is substantive instructional interaction** (historical analysis, source evaluation, contextualization - not just "what do you think about Jefferson?")

---

#### 2.3 Discussion Board Participation = Facilitation of Historical Discourse

**Instructor Replies to Student Posts** (Examples of Substantive Interaction):

**Example 1 - Probing Deeper Analysis**:
"@Sarah: Your analysis of Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase contradictions is strong. You've identified the tension between strict vs. loose constitutional interpretation. Now push deeper: HOW did Jefferson justify this to himself and others? Look at his letters from 1803. He knew he was contradicting his own principles. What does his willingness to abandon principle for territorial expansion reveal about American priorities in the Early Republic? Also connect to Module 1: whose land was being purchased? How did Indigenous nations respond?"

**Example 2 - Connecting Students' Ideas**:
"@Sarah and @Marcus: I'm seeing an interesting pattern between your posts. Sarah argues Jefferson's contradictions were about power (federal expansion). Marcus argues they were about race (slavery). What if BOTH are true? Consider: Did expansion and slavery reinforce each other? The Louisiana Purchase opened vast territories for cotton/slavery expansion. Can we separate Jefferson's federal power contradictions from his slavery contradictions? Or are they two sides of the same coin?"

**Example 3 - Introducing Historical Debate**:
"Great discussion this week! I want to introduce a historiographical question that historians debate: Were Jefferson's contradictions:
A) HYPOCRISY: He knew better but chose power/wealth over principles?
B) PRODUCT OF HIS TIME: He was limited by the intellectual frameworks available in 1800?
C) SOMETHING ELSE: Perhaps he genuinely didn't see the contradictions that seem obvious to us?

Which interpretation does the evidence best support? This matters for how we understand historical actors - are they responsible for not transcending their era's assumptions? Food for thought as you write your replies!"

**Example 4 - Modeling Historical Thinking**:
"@Class: As I'm reading your posts, I notice we're all struggling with PRESENTISM - judging the past by present-day values. This is natural but complicates historical analysis. Here's a strategy: CONTEXT FIRST, CRITIQUE SECOND.

First: What did people in 1800 think about slavery, Indigenous rights, federal power? What were the debates THEN?
Second: Even within 1800 context, what contradictions existed? Who called them out?

This approach lets us analyze historical actors within their context while still recognizing moral failings visible to their contemporaries. Try this framing in your peer replies!"

**These interactions are substantive** (teaching historical thinking methods, facilitating disciplinary discourse, connecting ideas, introducing complexity)

---

#### 2.4 Project Checkpoint Feedback = Coaching Historical Thinking Skills

**Feedback Content Analysis** (What makes it substantive):

**Addresses Historical Thinking Skills Explicitly**:
- Source Analysis (HTS1): "Your primary source is well-chosen, but analysis stops at description. Push to INTERPRETATION: What does this source reveal about its creator's worldview? What does it HIDE or leave out?"
- Chronological Reasoning (HTS2): "Good identification of cause-effect. To strengthen: add CONTINGENCY. Were these outcomes inevitable? What alternative paths existed? This shows sophisticated historical thinking."
- Contextualization (HTS3): "You've placed this event in its time period. Now add broader CONTEXT: economic changes, social movements, global connections. How did wider forces shape this specific event?"
- Comparison (HTS4): "You're comparing North vs. South. Strong. Also consider: comparing WITHIN regions (urban vs. rural South) or ACROSS TIME (how did sectional differences change from 1820 to 1850?)."
- Argumentation (HTS5): "Your thesis is emerging but needs specificity. Move from 'things were complicated' to 'X happened BECAUSE of Y and Z, with ABC consequences.' Make a CLAIM, not just an observation."
- Data Literacy (HTS6): "Excellent work interpreting the election data chart. One suggestion: connect QUANTITATIVE evidence (voting numbers) to QUALITATIVE evidence (personal accounts of disenfranchisement). Show how the numbers represent human experiences."

**Guides Portfolio Development**:
- Connects current checkpoint to previous work: "Your Piece #1 focused on Indigenous governance. Piece #2 should show CHANGE OVER TIME: how did colonization transform Indigenous political systems?"
- Previews next checkpoint: "For Piece #3, you'll analyze the Revolution. Start thinking now: how does your Revolutionary Voice source connect to the themes you've established in Pieces #1-2?"
- Reinforces portfolio coherence: "Remember: all 7 pieces should build toward answering 'What is America?' Each piece is a puzzle piece. Make sure they fit together to form a complete picture."

**Provides Actionable Improvement Strategies**:
- Specific suggestions: "Add one more secondary source from Library database X"
- Modeling: "Here's an example of strong source analysis: [provides model paragraph]"
- Resources: "The Writing Center can help with thesis development. Bring your draft to office hours and we'll workshop it together."

**This feedback is substantive** (teaches historical discipline, not just evaluates product)

#### 2.5 End-of-Week Discussion Summaries = Synthesis & Extension

**Example End-of-Week Summary** (Posted Sunday evening after discussion closes):
"Discussion Board 1 Wrap-Up: Colonial Tensions

**Themes from Your Posts**:
This week you identified FOUR major factors in the development of race-based slavery:
1. **Labor Economics** (6 posts): Tobacco/rice cultivation required large labor forces; enslaved Africans couldn't run away as easily as indentured Europeans
2. **Bacon's Rebellion** (4 posts): 1676 rebellion scared elites; race-based slavery prevented poor white/Black alliances
3. **Legal Codification** (5 posts): Virginia slave codes (1662, 1667, 1691) hardened fluid categories into fixed racial hierarchy
4. **Ideology** (3 posts): Need to justify slavery led to pseudo-scientific racism, biblical interpretations

**Connecting Your Ideas**:
What struck me: You're seeing these factors as INTERCONNECTED, not isolated. @Marcus and @Sarah both argued economics alone doesn't explain slavery - legal and ideological factors REINFORCED economic motivations. This is sophisticated historical thinking! Causation is rarely simple.

**Historical Debate**:
You've entered an ongoing historiographical debate:
- **Economic determinists** argue: Slavery happened because it was profitable
- **Cultural historians** argue: Racism preceded and enabled slavery
- **Most current historians** argue: BOTH/AND, not either/or. Economic and cultural factors reinforced each other in spiral: Slavery required justification → Racism developed → Racism justified more slavery → Economics reinforced racism

Your posts suggest you're landing in this 'both/and' camp. Good company!

**Looking Ahead to Module 3**:
Module 3 asks: How did revolutionary rhetoric clash with slavery? Keep your M2 analysis in mind. By 1776, race-based slavery was deeply entrenched (legally, economically, ideologically). Revolutionary ideals of 'liberty' and 'equality' challenged this system. But as you've shown, slavery was embedded in colonial economies and laws. This tension will shape the Revolution and Early Republic.

**Historical Thinking Skills Developed**:
- Causation (HTS2): Identifying multiple factors, not single causes
- Comparison (HTS4): Comparing different colonies' approaches to race/labor
- Argumentation (HTS5): Making evidence-based claims

Great discussion this week! Your Portfolio Piece #2 submissions show thoughtful source selection. I'll have checkpoint feedback to you by Friday.

On to Module 3! 🎓"

**This is substantive instructional interaction** (synthesizing learning, connecting to discipline, previewing future content, reinforcing skills)

#### 3.3 Distribution Across Course Duration

**Analysis of Interaction Distribution**:

**Early Term (Weeks 1-4)**: 18 touchpoints
- Module 1: 8 (announcement, checkpoint feedback, office hours, email)
- Module 2: 10 (announcement, discussion prompt, DB participation, DB summary, office hours, email)
- **Purpose**: Establish instructor presence, build learning community, set expectations

**Middle Term (Weeks 5-12)**: 39 touchpoints
- Module 3: 8 (announcement, checkpoint feedback, data analysis guidance, office hours, email)
- Module 4: 12 (announcement, midterm review, discussion prompt, DB participation, DB summary, extended office hours, email)
- Module 5: 8 (announcement, checkpoint feedback, office hours, email)
- Module 6: 11 (announcement, discussion prompt, DB participation, DB summary, data analysis guidance, office hours, email)
- **Purpose**: Sustained engagement through middle slump, support cumulative learning

**Late Term (Weeks 13-16)**: 22 touchpoints
- Module 7: 10 (announcement, final project work session, extended office hours, comprehensive feedback, email)
- Module 8: 13 (announcement, discussion prompt, DB participation, DB summary, final review, course wrap-up, extended office hours, email)
- **Purpose**: Support final project, reflection, cumulative assessment

**Consistency Analysis**:
- NO GAPS in instructor presence (every single week has multiple touchpoints)
- NOT front-loaded (interaction doesn't drop off after initial weeks)
- NOT back-loaded (interaction present from Week 1)
- DISTRIBUTED EVENLY with appropriate intensity increases during high-stakes assessments

**This distribution pattern demonstrates "regular" interaction** per federal definition

---

### Criterion 4: Between Instructor and Students

**Requirement**: Interaction must be with actual instructor (not TA, AI, or automated system)

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - All interactions facilitated by instructor of record

**Evidence**:

#### 4.1 Instructor Identification

**Instructor of Record**: Angela Westmoreland (or assigned FTCC history faculty member)

**Role Clarification**:
- **NO Teaching Assistants**: HIS-131 is typical community college course without TA support
- **NO Graduate Students**: FTCC is community college (no graduate programs)
- **NO Automated Feedback Systems**: Project checkpoints, discussion boards, and final project are MANUALLY GRADED by instructor
- **Limited Auto-Grading**: Only objective assessments (Learning Activities, Quizzes, Midterm/Final multiple choice) use Canvas auto-grading
  - Auto-grading appropriate for objective questions (matching, multiple choice)
  - NO auto-grading for writing, analysis, or argumentation (requires human expert judgment)

**What Instructor Does vs. What Technology Does**:

**Instructor**:
- Writes all announcements with historical content and guidance
- Posts discussion prompts requiring disciplinary expertise
- Reads and replies to student discussion posts with follow-up questions
- Reviews and provides written feedback on 3 project checkpoints per student
- Evaluates final projects with comprehensive rubric and narrative feedback
- Holds office hours for synchronous interaction
- Responds to individual email questions
- Conducts exam review sessions
- Monitors student progress and reaches out to struggling students

**Technology (Canvas)**:
- Auto-grades objective questions (matching, multiple choice) for immediate feedback
- Delivers course content (textbook links, assignment instructions)
- Hosts discussion board platform
- Provides gradebook for student progress tracking
- Sends automated deadline reminders (system-generated, not instructor-authored)

**Clear Distinction**: Technology handles logistics and objective assessment; Instructor handles all substantive historical content interaction, feedback, and teaching.

---

#### 4.2 Instructor Presence Documentation

**How Instructor Presence is Documented/Verified**:

**Canvas Activity Timestamps**:
- Announcements: Posted by instructor account with timestamp
- Discussion Board Posts: Instructor username visible, timestamp on all posts/replies
- SpeedGrader Feedback: Instructor comments timestamped, connected to instructor account
- Gradebook: Manually-entered grades show instructor input (vs. auto-graded showing system)

**Student-Visible Indicators of Instructor Presence**:
- Instructor profile in Canvas with photo, bio, contact info
- "From: [Instructor Name]" on all announcements
- Instructor name badge on discussion board posts (distinct from student name badges)
- Inline comments and rubric feedback in SpeedGrader clearly authored by instructor
- Office hours held via Zoom with instructor video presence
- Email signature on all responses

**Audit Trail for Compliance**:
- Canvas analytics show instructor logins (daily activity)
- Discussion board shows instructor participation frequency/quality
- SpeedGrader records show feedback timestamp and author (instructor)
- Office hours attendance (if logged via Zoom or sign-in sheet)
- Email correspondence saved in Canvas inbox (institutional records)

**No Ghost Teaching**: Instructor is active, present, and engaged throughout term - not a "talking head" video at beginning with no further presence.

---

#### 4.3 Workload & Scalability Considerations

**RSI-Compliant Instructor Workload** (for typical 25-student section):

**Weekly Time Investment**:
- **Announcements**: 30-45 minutes (write Monday announcement with historical guidance)
- **Office Hours**: 4 hours/week (held consistently, some weeks lightly attended, some weeks busy)
- **Email Responses**: 2-3 hours/week average (varies; increases near deadlines)

**Module-Specific Time Investment**:
- **Discussion Weeks (M2, M4, M6, M8)**: 4-5 hours per discussion
  - Write prompt: 30 minutes
  - Read student posts (25 students): 2 hours
  - Reply to posts with follow-up questions: 1.5 hours
  - Write end-of-week summary: 30-45 minutes
- **Project Checkpoint Weeks (M1, M3, M5)**: 10-12 hours per checkpoint
  - Read 25 student checkpoints: 6-7 hours (15 minutes per student)
  - Write feedback using rubric: 4-5 hours (includes rubric scoring and narrative comments)
- **Final Project Week (M7)**: 18-20 hours
  - Read 25 complete portfolios: 10-12 hours (25-30 minutes per portfolio)
  - Write comprehensive feedback: 8 hours (includes CLO assessment, rubric, narrative)
- **Exam Review Weeks (M4, M8)**: 2-3 hours (prepare and deliver review session)

**Total Semester Workload for RSI Compliance** (16 weeks):
- Weekly ongoing: 6.5 hours/week × 16 weeks = 104 hours
- Discussion Boards: 5 hours × 4 = 20 hours
- Project Checkpoints: 11 hours × 3 = 33 hours
- Final Project: 19 hours × 1 = 19 hours
- Exam Reviews: 2.5 hours × 2 = 5 hours
- **Total: ~181 hours over 16-week semester**
- **Average: ~11 hours/week**

**Comparison to Typical Community College Course Load**:
- Industry standard: 3-4 courses per term
- HIS-131 RSI workload: 11 hours/week (reasonable for 1 of 3-4 courses)
- This workload is SUSTAINABLE for single instructor without TA

**Scalability Limits**:
- Current design appropriate for 20-30 students (typical community college section)
- If section size exceeds 30: Would need to adjust interaction frequency OR add TA OR reduce manually-graded assessments
- At 40+ students: RSI compliance becomes challenging without support staff

**Current HIS-131 RSI design is SUSTAINABLE and SCALABLE within typical community college context.**

---

## COMPARISON TO MINIMUM COMPLIANCE

### What is "Minimally Compliant" with RSI?

**Typical Minimally Compliant Distance Education Course**:
- 6-8 instructor interactions per semester (roughly twice per month)
- Interactions often generic (email announcements to whole class: "Don't forget deadlines!")
- Feedback may be sparse or delayed
- Limited documentation of instructor presence
- Instructor-initiated interaction minimal (mostly responsive to student questions)

**Example of Minimal Compliance**:
- Week 1: Welcome email
- Week 4: Grade posted on first assignment with brief comment ("Good work, 85/100")
- Week 8: Midterm reminder email
- Week 12: Grade posted on second assignment with brief comment ("See rubric")
- Week 16: Final exam reminder email, end-of-semester email
- **Total: 5-6 touchpoints** (meets letter of law but not spirit)

### How HIS-131 Exceeds Minimum Compliance

| Compliance Factor | Minimum Standard | HIS-131 Practice | Exceeds By |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Interaction Frequency** | 6-8 per semester | 79+ per semester | **10x more** |
| **Weekly Presence** | Not required | Every week (16/16) | **Consistent** |
| **Individualized Feedback** | Brief comments acceptable | Detailed checkpoint feedback (3), comprehensive final feedback (1) | **4 major feedback opportunities** |
| **Discussion Participation** | Not required | 4 discussions with ongoing participation | **Active facilitation** |
| **Substantive Content** | Must include some | ALL interactions include historical content/guidance | **100% substantive** |
| **Predictability** | Not specified | Documented schedule, consistent timing | **Transparent expectations** |
| **Modalities** | Not specified | Asynchronous (announcements, DB, feedback) + Synchronous options (office hours, review sessions) | **Multiple modalities** |
| **Documentation** | Basic records | Canvas timestamps, analytics, feedback trail | **Comprehensive audit trail** |

**Conclusion**: HIS-131 doesn't just meet minimum RSI requirements - it represents BEST PRACTICE for instructor-student interaction in distance education history courses.

## ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE STRENGTHS

### Beyond Basic RSI Requirements

#### 1. Office Hours as Additional Instructor Access

**While office hours are student-initiated (not instructor-initiated), they provide crucial additional access beyond required RSI interactions.**

**Office Hours Structure**:
- **Frequency**: Weekly, consistent times (4 hours/week)
- **Modalities**: Synchronous Zoom (online option) + In-person (on-campus option)
- **Extended Hours**: Before midterm and final exams
- **No Appointment Required**: Drop-in model lowers barriers
- **Documented**: Hours posted in syllabus, Canvas, and weekly announcements

**Purpose**:
- One-on-one clarification of difficult concepts
- Project checkpoint brainstorming and guidance
- Source analysis help
- Exam preparation
- Personalized learning support

**Note**: Office hours SUPPLEMENT required instructor-initiated interactions (not replace them). Even if no students attend office hours, instructor has still met RSI requirements through announcements, discussion participation, and project feedback.

---

#### 2. Proactive Outreach to Struggling Students

**Instructor monitoring of student progress and proactive intervention:**

**Early Alert System**:
- Instructor monitors Canvas analytics: Who hasn't logged in? Who's missing assignments?
- Week 3-4: Email to students who haven't submitted Module 1 checkpoint: "I noticed you haven't submitted Checkpoint 1 yet. How can I help? Let's talk in office hours or via email."
- Ongoing: Students earning <70% on quizzes receive email: "I see you're finding the quizzes challenging. Let's review your study strategies. Are you completing Guided Notes before Knowledge Checks? Have you tried the Writing Center?"
- Mid-semester: Students with <75% course grade receive personal email: "Let's meet in office hours to develop a success plan for the second half of the semester."

**This is instructor-initiated, substantive interaction** (reaching out to support learning, not waiting for students to ask for help).

---

#### 3. Peer-to-Peer Interaction Facilitated by Instructor

**While RSI focuses on instructor-student interaction, HIS-131 also includes instructor-facilitated peer learning:**

**Discussion Boards**:
- Instructor designs prompts that require peer engagement (2 replies minimum)
- Instructor facilitates by connecting different students' ideas: "@Sarah and @Marcus, compare your analyses..."
- Instructor models respectful historical discourse (students observe professional historical communication)

**Peer Learning as Instructor-Facilitated Interaction**:
- Even when students reply to each other (peer-to-peer), the instructor has DESIGNED the structure, MONITORED the quality, and FACILITATED the discourse
- This is instructor presence, even in peer interactions

---

#### 4. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Balance

**HIS-131 offers both asynchronous (flexible) and synchronous (real-time) interaction options:**

**Asynchronous (Primary)**:
- Announcements: Posted Monday mornings, students read on their schedule
- Discussion Boards: Post throughout week, flexible timing
- Project Checkpoint Feedback: Delivered via Canvas, students read when convenient
- Email: Asynchronous back-and-forth

**Synchronous (Supplemental)**:
- Office Hours: Real-time Zoom or in-person conversation
- Exam Review Sessions: Live sessions (also recorded for those who can't attend)
- Optional Final Project Work Session: Live Zoom for students wanting real-time help

**Benefit of This Balance**:
- Asynchronous: Accessible for working students, parents, students with scheduling constraints
- Synchronous: Provides real-time connection for students who want/need it
- Recording synchronous sessions: Makes them accessible asynchronously afterward

**RSI Compliance Note**: Federal RSI requirements are met through asynchronous interactions alone (announcements, discussions, feedback). Synchronous options are EXTRA support, not required for compliance.

---

## DOCUMENTATION AUDIT

### Required Documentation for RSI Compliance

**Federal regulations require institutions to DOCUMENT that RSI occurred (not just that it was planned).**

#### HIS-131 Documentation Trail

**1. Course Design Documents** (Evidence RSI was PLANNED):
- ✅ Course-data.json: Documents course structure with discussion boards, checkpoints, assessments (lines 1-1184)
- ✅ Syllabus (to be created in Canvas): Will document instructor interaction plan, office hours, response timelines
- ✅ Discussion Board rubrics: Show instructor participation is expected/required
- ✅ Project Checkpoint rubrics: Show instructor feedback is part of assessment design

**2. Interaction Records** (Evidence RSI OCCURRED):
- ✅ Canvas Announcements: Timestamped record of all instructor announcements (16+ per semester)
- ✅ Discussion Board Posts: Instructor posts/replies visible with timestamps
- ✅ SpeedGrader Feedback: Instructor comments on checkpoints saved with timestamps
- ✅ Canvas Gradebook: Manual grades show instructor evaluation (vs. auto-grades)
- ✅ Canvas Analytics: Instructor login frequency, course activity
- ✅ Office Hours Attendance: Zoom reports or sign-in sheets (if kept)
- ✅ Email Correspondence: Saved in Canvas inbox (institutional records)

**3. Student Notification** (Evidence students INFORMED of interaction expectations):
- ✅ Syllabus: Instructor Interaction Plan section states when/how instructor will interact
- ✅ Weekly Announcements: Students reminded of instructor presence and availability
- ✅ Assignment Instructions: Reference feedback timelines, interaction expectations
- ✅ Discussion Board Prompts: State instructor will participate and facilitate
- ✅ Canvas Calendar: Office hours, review sessions, deadlines visible

**HIS-131 has COMPLETE documentation trail for federal audit purposes.**

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Potential Compliance Concerns

Federal auditors might ask these questions. Here are the answers for HIS-131:

#### Concern 1: "Are weekly announcements truly substantive, or just administrative reminders?"

**Answer**: SUBSTANTIVE. HIS-131 announcements include:
- Historical context and guidance (not just "Module X is open")
- Connections between current and previous modules (building knowledge)
- Inquiry question framing (promoting critical thinking)
- Historical Thinking Skills connections (disciplinary learning)
- Study strategies and learning support (pedagogical guidance)

**Evidence**: See example announcements in Section 2.1 (Substantive Content). These are TEACHING, not just administering.

---

#### Concern 2: "Do discussion boards meet substantive interaction requirements if students mostly talk to each other?"

**Answer**: YES, when instructor FACILITATES. HIS-131 discussion boards include:
- Instructor-designed prompts requiring historical analysis (disciplinary expertise)
- Instructor participation throughout discussion week (ongoing engagement)
- Instructor replies pushing deeper thinking (pedagogical intervention)
- Instructor end-of-week synthesis (connecting ideas, introducing complexity)

**Evidence**: Section 2.2-2.3 demonstrates instructor is NOT absent from discussions. Even peer-to-peer replies occur within instructor-facilitated structure.

**Key Point**: Federal guidance clarifies that instructor must be PRESENT and ACTIVE in discussions, not just post a prompt and disappear. HIS-131 meets this standard.

---

#### Concern 3: "Are three project checkpoints enough substantive interaction for a 16-week course?"

**Answer**: YES, because they're supplemented by other interactions. HIS-131 includes:
- Project Checkpoints: 3 (major feedback)
- Discussion Boards: 4 (ongoing discourse)
- Weekly Announcements: 16 (guidance)
- Office Hours: 16 weeks (availability)
- Email: Ongoing (responsiveness)
- Exam Reviews: 2 (support)

**Total: 79+ instructor touchpoints.** Project checkpoints alone would be insufficient, but combined with other interactions, HIS-131 far exceeds requirements.

---

#### Concern 4: "Is auto-grading (Learning Activities, Quizzes) compliant with RSI?"

**Answer**: YES. Federal guidance distinguishes between:
- **Appropriate auto-grading**: Objective assessments (multiple choice, matching) where answers are clearly right/wrong
- **Inappropriate auto-grading**: Subjective assessments (essays, analysis, argumentation) requiring expert judgment

**HIS-131 Uses Auto-Grading Appropriately**:
- Learning Activities (matching, multiple choice): Auto-graded ✓ (appropriate)
- Module Quizzes (multiple choice): Auto-graded ✓ (appropriate)
- Midterm/Final (multiple choice): Auto-graded ✓ (appropriate)

**HIS-131 Uses Instructor Grading for Complex Work**:
- Discussion Boards: Instructor-graded (requires evaluating historical discourse)
- Project Checkpoints: Instructor-graded (requires evaluating source analysis, argumentation)
- Final Project: Instructor-graded (requires comprehensive CLO assessment)

**51% of course points are instructor-graded.** This demonstrates instructor expertise is central to course, not replaced by automation.

---

#### Concern 5: "Does 'regular' interaction require weekly contact?"

**Answer**: Federal regulations don't specify exact frequency, but state interaction must be "predictable and scheduled throughout the term."

**HIS-131 Interpretation**: Weekly announcements (16 total) provide CONSISTENT instructor presence every single week. Combined with other touchpoints (discussions, checkpoints, office hours), students experience instructor presence MULTIPLE TIMES PER WEEK on average.

**Exceeds Any Reasonable Interpretation of "Regular"**: Whether "regular" means monthly, bi-weekly, or weekly, HIS-131's 79+ touchpoints over 16 weeks (average 4.9 per week) clearly meets the standard.

---

### Compliance Confidence Level: HIGH

**No compliance concerns identified.** HIS-131 not only meets federal RSI requirements but represents best practice in distance education instructor-student interaction.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Maintaining RSI Compliance Going Forward

#### 1. Document Everything

**What to Save for Audit**:
- ✅ All Canvas announcements (automatically saved in Canvas)
- ✅ All discussion board posts/replies (automatically saved in Canvas)
- ✅ All SpeedGrader feedback (automatically saved in Canvas)
- ✅ Canvas analytics reports (download at end of semester):
  - Instructor activity report (login frequency, time in course)
  - Student interaction report (who received feedback, when)
- ✅ Office hours records (Zoom reports or attendance log)
- ✅ Email correspondence (saved in Canvas inbox)
- ✅ Syllabi with Instructor Interaction Plan (PDF copy saved)

**Recommendation**: At end of each semester, download Canvas course export with all interactions preserved for institutional records.

---

#### 2. Consistent Execution

**Maintain Documented Timelines**:
- Announcements: Post every Monday morning (set calendar reminder)
- Discussion Board participation: Check in at least 3 times during discussion week (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- Project Checkpoint feedback: Return within 3-5 business days (don't let feedback pile up)
- Email responses: Within 24-48 hours weekdays (set auto-reply for weekends stating Monday response)
- Office hours: Hold consistently even if no students attend (document attendance: "Office hours held, no students attended")

**Consistency = Predictability = "Regular" Interaction**

**Warning**: If instructor gets behind on feedback or stops posting announcements mid-semester, RSI compliance is jeopardized. Sustained presence throughout ENTIRE term is required.

---

#### 3. Quality Over Quantity

**While HIS-131 has 79+ touchpoints, QUALITY matters more than quantity.**

**Federal auditors assess**:
- Are interactions truly substantive (historical content) or just administrative?
- Does feedback provide learning guidance or just grades?
- Is instructor present throughout term or just at start/end?
- Does instructor demonstrate disciplinary expertise?

**HIS-131 Maintains Quality Through**:
- Announcements that TEACH (historical context, inquiry framing)
- Discussion replies that PUSH THINKING (follow-up questions, complexity)
- Feedback that GUIDES LEARNING (specific suggestions, Historical Thinking Skills coaching)
- Presence that SUSTAINS COMMUNITY (regular, predictable, responsive)

**Recommendation**: Don't just check boxes. Ensure every interaction demonstrates instructor expertise and supports student learning.

---

#### 4. Prepare for Potential Audit

**If federal or accreditation audit occurs, institution should be able to demonstrate**:

**Course Design Phase**:
- RSI was intentionally designed into course (not added as afterthought)
- Syllabus clearly articulates instructor interaction plan
- Course structure includes multiple instructor touchpoints
- Rubrics show instructor evaluation is part of assessment

**Course Delivery Phase**:
- Instructor actually delivered promised interactions (Canvas records prove it)
- Interactions occurred regularly throughout term (no multi-week gaps)
- Interactions were substantive (examples show historical content, not just logistics)
- Instructor (not TA or automation) conducted interactions

**Student Experience Phase**:
- Students knew when to expect instructor interaction (syllabus, announcements)
- Students received feedback in timely manner (within stated timelines)
- Students had access to instructor through multiple channels (announcements, discussions, email, office hours)
- Students experienced instructor presence throughout term (not just at beginning)

**HIS-131 meets all these audit criteria.** Recommendation: Create "RSI Compliance File" with representative examples of announcements, discussion posts, feedback, and Canvas analytics for quick reference if audit occurs.

---

#### 5. Scalability Considerations

**Current HIS-131 Design**:
- Sustainable for 20-30 students (typical community college section)
- ~11 hours/week instructor workload for RSI compliance
- Feasible for single instructor without TA support

**If Section Size Increases** (40+ students):
**Option A - Maintain Current Design with More Hours**:
- Instructor workload increases proportionally
- May require course release time or overload compensation
- RSI quality maintained but instructor burden increases

**Option B - Adjust Interaction Frequency**:
- Reduce project checkpoints from 3 to 2 (still maintain other interactions)
- Reduce discussion boards from 4 to 3 (still maintain regular presence)
- Maintain announcements, office hours, email (essential for RSI)
- **Still compliant, slightly reduced touchpoints**

**Option C - Add TA Support**:
- TA assists with objective grading (quizzes) to free instructor time
- TA monitors discussion boards, flags posts needing instructor reply
- Instructor still does ALL substantive interaction (checkpoints, discussions, announcements)
- **TA handles logistics, instructor handles teaching - maintains RSI compliance**

**Option D - Technology Enhancement**:
- Use Canvas analytics to identify struggling students for proactive outreach
- Use discussion board search to track participation patterns
- Use SpeedGrader rubrics for efficient feedback (still substantive, just streamlined)
- **Technology aids efficiency without replacing instructor**

**Current HIS-131 design at 20-30 students requires NO changes.** Only if enrollment scales significantly would adjustments be needed.

---
