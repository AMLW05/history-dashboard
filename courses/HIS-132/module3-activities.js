  instructions: `**Module 3 Project Checkpoint: Piece #3 - Progressive Reforms Map**

**Task:**
Create a visual or written analysis exploring: **"Who benefited from Progressive reforms, and who was left behind?"**

**Requirements:**
- Analyze at least THREE different Progressive reforms (e.g., labor laws, food safety, women's suffrage, political reforms, Americanization, eugenics)
- Identify which groups benefited from each reform
- Identify which groups were excluded or harmed

- Comparison chart/infographic showing "Included" vs. "Excluded" for each reform
- Written analysis (500-600 words)
- Visual timeline with analysis of reform impacts
- Annotated map showing geographic patterns of reform (e.g., suffrage by state)

**Reflection Question:**
How do these Progressive Era contradictions (reform + exclusion) complicate your definition of "What is America?" from Module 1?

- Upload to Canvas by end of Module 3
- This becomes part of your Final Portfolio in Module 7`,
