## REGULAR AND SUBSTANTIVE INTERACTION (RSI) COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Federal Requirement Overview

Per 34 CFR § 600.2 (Department of Education Distance Education Regulations):

**"Regular and Substantive Interaction"** means:
- **Regular**: Predictable, scheduled, throughout the term (not sporadically)
- **Substantive**: Engagement with students on course content and learning (not just administrative)
- **Instructor-Initiated**: Instructor proactively reaches out (not just responsive to student requests)
- **Between Instructor and Students**: Actual faculty member (not just TA or automated system)

### HUM-130 RSI Compliance Status: ✅ **EXCEEDS FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS**

**Summary**: HUM-130 demonstrates exceptional compliance with RSI requirements through systematic, instructor-initiated, substantive interactions throughout the 16-week term.

---

### RSI Criterion 1: Instructor-Initiated Interaction

**Requirement**: Instructor must initiate interaction (not just respond to student requests)

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - Multiple instructor-initiated touchpoints

**Evidence**:

#### 1.1 Bi-Weekly Course Announcements (8 announcements)
- **Frequency**: Every 2 weeks throughout 16-week term (one per module)
- **Initiative**: Instructor posts guidance for each module
- **Substantive**: Not just reminders; includes mythological context, study tips, connections between ancient and modern myths
- **Example**: "This week in Module 3, we explore Star Wars as modern mythology. As you watch the films, look for Campbell's Hero's Journey stages in Luke's story. Consider our inquiry question: How does Star Wars consciously recreate the Hero's Journey for modern audiences? Pay special attention to the mentor figures, threshold guardians, and the transformation in the cave..."

#### 1.2 Discussion Board Prompts (4 times)
- **Frequency**: Modules 2, 4, 6, 8 (distributed throughout term)
- **Initiative**: Instructor posts discussion prompts and participates in threads
- **Substantive**: Prompts tied to inquiry questions, require evidence-based analysis of mythological patterns
- **Example M2 Prompt**: "Heroic Ideals & Portfolio Piece #2: How do different cultures define the 'ideal hero'? Compare Greek arete, Norse honor, and Eastern duty. Share your Portfolio Piece #2 analyzing heroic qualities in your chosen modern myth..."

#### 1.3 Project Checkpoint Feedback (3 times)
- **Frequency**: Modules 1, 3, 5 (spaced throughout first 10 weeks)
- **Initiative**: Instructor reviews and provides individualized feedback on each student's mythological analysis
- **Substantive**: Feedback addresses mythological analysis quality, use of course frameworks, argumentation, guides improvement for next checkpoint
- **Example Feedback**: "Your analysis of the Hero's Journey in Star Wars shows good identification of the stages. To strengthen this checkpoint, consider examining HOW Star Wars adapts these stages for a contemporary audience—what changes does Lucas make to Campbell's framework? Look at the role of technology in the 'magic weapons' stage..."

#### 1.4 Final Project Feedback (1 time)
- **Frequency**: Module 7
- **Initiative**: Instructor evaluates comprehensive portfolio with detailed feedback
- **Substantive**: Feedback addresses synthesis of entire course, mythological thinking skills demonstrated, cultural analysis quality
- **Point Value**: 200 pts (highest-stakes assessment) demonstrates significance of instructor evaluation

---

### RSI Criterion 2: Substantive Interaction (Instructional Content)

**Requirement**: Interaction must engage students on course content and learning (not just administrative)

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - All interactions focus on mythological learning, not administration

**Evidence**:

- Linking current module to previous learning (building connections across ancient and modern myths)

**NOT administrative** (not just: "Module 3 is now open" or "Remember to submit on time")

#### 2.2 Discussion Board Participation = Mythological Discourse
**Nature of Interaction**:
- Posing inquiry questions requiring mythological analysis
- Responding to student posts with follow-up questions pushing deeper thinking about archetypes and patterns
- Facilitating peer learning by connecting different students' perspectives on mythology
- Summarizing discussion themes and connecting to course CLOs and Mythological Thinking Skills

**Example Instructor Reply**: "You raise an important point about Harry Potter as a 'chosen one' figure. How does the prophecy function differently than traditional Greek/Norse prophecies? What does this adaptation reveal about contemporary views on fate versus free will? Consider bringing in evidence from Module 2's discussion of epic heroes..."

#### 2.3 Project Checkpoint Feedback = Mythological Thinking Coaching
**Nature of Interaction**:
- Evaluating mythological analysis quality (CLO1, CLO2)
- Assessing application of frameworks (Hero's Journey, archetypes) to modern narratives (CLO3)
- Guiding improvement in demonstrating understanding (CLO4)
- Connecting student work to Mythological Thinking Skills framework

**NOT generic feedback** ("Good job" or "Needs more detail")

#### 2.4 Midterm/Final Review (2 times)
**Nature of Interaction** (if offered):
- Reviewing key mythological patterns across modules
- Clarifying difficult concepts (symbolic interpretation, comparative analysis)
- Providing strategies for synthesizing ancient and modern mythology
- Connecting content across modules (creation myths → Hero's Journey → modern applications)
